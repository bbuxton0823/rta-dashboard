# RTA Application Dashboard Web Application

This web application provides an interactive dashboard for managing and analyzing RTA (Request for Tenancy Approval) applications. It is designed to be a web-based version of the Excel dashboard, with enhanced interactive features.

## Features

1. **Interactive Dashboard**
   - Key metrics display (total applications, approval rate, processing days, pending inspections)
   - Process timeline visualization
   - Status distribution charts
   - Program performance analysis
   - Geographic distribution visualization

2. **Data Management**
   - Form-based data entry for new RTA records
   - Data validation and error checking
   - Record viewing and editing
   - Searchable data table with pagination

3. **Advanced Analysis**
   - Interactive filtering by date, program, inspector, city, and status
   - Drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis
   - Performance metrics for programs and inspectors
   - Trend analysis with historical data

## Technology Stack

The dashboard is built using modern web technologies:

- **HTML5/CSS3**: Responsive layout with Bootstrap 5 framework
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality and interactive features
- **Chart.js (v3.9.1)**: Data visualization components
- **jQuery**: DOM manipulation and UI components
- **daterangepicker**: Date range selection
- **Bootstrap Icons**: UI icons and visual elements

## Data Structure

The application loads data from a JSON file (`rta_data.json`) which contains:

- `main_data`: Array of RTA records
- `lookup_values`: Reference values for dropdowns and validation
- `columns`: Column definitions
- `sheet_names`: Original Excel sheet names
